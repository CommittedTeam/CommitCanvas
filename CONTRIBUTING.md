# How to contribute

Here are some important resources:

  * Email: Dr. Kapfhammer(gkapfham@allegheny.edu) and Teona Bagashvili(bagashvilit@allegheny.edu)
  * Bugs? Use the GitHub Issue Tracker.

## Testing

Please refer to [README.md](README.md) for information about automated testing and linting.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/facial_recognition_bias) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](pull_request_template.md). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

You can help improve the guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date.

To do so, make changes then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

If you have other questions or concerns please email the contributors of this project.
